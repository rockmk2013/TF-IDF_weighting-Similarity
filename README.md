# TF-IDF_weighting
This is a project that implements TF-IDF,using the data of 2000 documents.I use stemmer and parser to clean the word. Then, I use the cosine and jaccard method to caculate the similarity and use the TF-IDF weighting to caculate the word frequency.
#run the code
when you run this code, the program will want you input a query to caculate this word's score in the documents.
